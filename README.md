Dear reader.

With 10+ years of experience in creating and delivering user-centric applications and solutions, I look forward to bringing my strong creative, technical, and analytical skills to the Full-Stack Role.

Throughout my career, I have been acknowledged as a solution-focused professional with the ability to design and develop innovative applications using advanced technologies. In my current role as a Full-stack Developer for Accenture, I collaborate closely with the application team to develop and implement many full-stack web applications, ensuring optimal functionality, quality, and reliability. Please consider the following highlights of my career:
 
●	Successfully designed and delivered more than 10 mobile applications and REST APIs to support 5 million requests monthly
●	Reduced time to market from several days to less than 10 hours by creating and executing a suite of Jenkins based automated build tools and automated testing.
●	Contributed to a major transition from EXTJs to Angular, which enhanced the overall speed and quality of new product development by 30%
●	Increased website code efficiency (reduction) of  client projects by over 20% each
●	Collaborated on a client project which won the 2019 UK Best IT award for Innovation
